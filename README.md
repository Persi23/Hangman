This is a web-based Hangman game built using Python and Flask. Players can guess letters to uncover a randomly chosen word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends. The game dynamically updates the display, tracks remaining lives, and visually shows the hangmanâ€™s progression. Simple, fun, and fully interactive!
